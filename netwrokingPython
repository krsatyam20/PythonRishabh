What is Sockets ?

	Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional(Two way) communications channel.
	
	Domain
		AF_INET, PF_INET, PF_UNIX, PF_X25, and so on.
	type
		The type of communications between the two endpoints, 
		=>SOCK_STREAM for connection-oriented protocols 
		=>SOCK_DGRAM for connectionless protocols.
	
	protocol

	hostname
			The identifier of a network interface
	
	port
		A port may be a Fixnum port number
		
	
The socket Module
	you must use the socket.socket() function available in socket module, 
		which has the general syntax −

    s = socket.socket (socket_family, socket_type, protocol=0)

	=>socket_family − This is either AF_UNIX or AF_INET.

	=>socket_type − This is either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM.

	=>protocol − This is usually left out, defaulting to 0.

Server Socket Methods
	
	=>s.bind() :This method binds address (hostname, port number pair) to 
		        socket.

	=>s.listen() :This method sets up and start TCP listener.

	=>s.accept() :This passively accept TCP client connection, waiting until 
				  connection arrives (blocking).
				  
Client Socket Methods
	
	=>s.connect() :This method actively initiates TCP server connection.	
	

General Socket Methods
		
	=>s.recv() :This method receives TCP message
	
	=>s.send() :This method transmits TCP message
	
	=>s.recvfrom() :This method receives UDP message
	
	=>s.sendto() :This method transmits UDP message

    =>s.close() :This method closes socket

	=>socket.gethostname() :Returns the hostname.
